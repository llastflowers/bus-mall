USER STORIES

1. As a marketing researcher, I want to see how often the same person chooses the same product repeatedly and which items are not selected at all most often, so I can zero in on the most and least popular items and thus determine the ideal number of items to feature in our catalog--we want enough variety, but not too many options.

2. As a marketing researcher, I want to see how people respond to these materials so that I can predict which types of products are attractive to our demographic and minimize the cost of manufacturing and advertizing unpopular items.

3. As a focus group participant, I want to view all of these new products because I am curious about interesting new items that are being invented and manufactured.

4. As a focus group participant who rides on public transit often, I want to give my feedback on the items that may appear in the catalog because I may want to view the catalog in the future for entertainment or to make purchases.
